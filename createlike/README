a. You need to make a T-TOF fit function.
  1. Create a WCSim MC, in which you don't have dark-rate or "Timewalk".
     Here, "Timewalk" means a triggering effect to delay the trigger time due to the number of hits.
     i.e. You have to make a special version of WCSim, by removing TriggerTiems an offset on digihittime:
>> WCSimWCDigitizer.cc, Line ~431
> G4double digihittime =
> //-TriggerTimes[G]
> //+ WCSimWCDigitizer::offset
> //+ 
> firstHitTime
> + hittimesmearing;
  2. To Copy the ouput root file to the "analysis_wcsim" dir here.
     To Edit analysis.C and fit your new output file.
	 New fit function to reproduce T-TOF function will be generated.

  3. To make a new case branch in create_like.cc.
     Output bin file could be used as a likelihood function.
